Neural Networks
===============
This is a brief introduction to the mathematical theory behind neural networks to familiarize the reader with our
choice of notation and highlight the difference between neural networks and neural operators.

Neural Operators - Theory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Traditionally, neural networks learn a mapping between vector spaces, such as :math:`f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m`.
The function :math:`f` maps on vector to another, such as the features of an image to a classification.
We denote the neural network's approximation as :math:`\hat{f}`, and can visualize this relationship below.

   Neural networks approximate a function between vectors.

In contrast, neural operators do not map one vector to another.
Rather, neural operators map a function to another function as :math:`\mathcal{L}: f \to g`.
Common examples include the derivative and integral operators, that map functions as their name suggests.
Other examples include the fourier transform :math:`\mathcal{F}` that maps a function in time to a function in frequency.

In the context of differential equations, we are given the operator :math:`\mathcal{L}` and the
function :math:`g`, and are trying to find solutions to the equation :math:`\mathcal{L}f = g`.
Here the operator might be the Laplacian :math:`\mathcal{L}f := \nabla^2 f`, or some second order differential
:math:`\mathcal{L}f := af''(x) + bf'(x) + cf`.

Neural operators deviate from the typical differential equation problem by assuming both :math:`f` and :math:`g` are
given and trying to find the operator :math:`\mathcal{L}` that satisfies :math:`\mathcal{L}f = g`.
Rather than trying to find :math:`\mathcal{L}` symbolically, we train a neural network to find an approximation that we
denote :math:`\hat{\mathcal{L}}`. We can visualize this relationship as:

   :align: center
   :class: with-border
   :width: 300
   :alt: A diagram showing a neural network approximating the operator from one function to another.

   Neural operators approximate an operator between functions.

This requires many realizations of :math:`f` paired with the output :math:`g` and we
try to find an approximation :math:`\hat{\mathcal{L}}` that minimizes the loss on the input-output pairs.
This framework is further explored in the section below.
