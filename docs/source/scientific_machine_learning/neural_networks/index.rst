Neural Networks
===============
This section implements a handful of common neural network and neural architectures.
The :class:`FeedForwardNeuralNetwork` does not change the architecture of a neural network, but provides an easy interface
to control the behavior of the Bayesian and Dropout layers introduced in this module.
