abstract = {In this paper, we provide a framework based upon diffusion processes for finding meaningful geometric descriptions of data sets. We show that eigenfunctions of Markov matrices can be used to construct coordinates called diffusion maps that generate efficient representations of complex geometric structures. The associated family of diffusion distances, obtained by iterating the Markov matrix, defines multiscale geometries that prove to be useful in the context of data parametrization and dimensionality reduction. The proposed framework relates the spectral properties of Markov processes to their geometric counterparts and it unifies ideas arising in a variety of contexts such as machine learning, spectral graph theory and eigenmap methods.}

abstract = {Summary In this work, an adaptive simplex stochastic collocation method is introduced in which sample refinement is informed by variability in the solution of the system. The proposed method is based on the concept of multi-element stochastic collocation methods and is capable of dealing with very high-dimensional models whose solutions are expressed as a vector, a matrix, or a tensor. The method leverages random samples to create a multi-element polynomial chaos surrogate model that incorporates local anisotropy in the refinement, informed by the variance of the estimated solution. This feature makes it beneficial for strongly nonlinear and/or discontinuous problems with correlated non-Gaussian uncertainties. To solve large systems, a reduced-order model (ROM) of the high-dimensional response is identified using singular value decomposition (higher-order SVD for matrix/tensor solutions) and polynomial chaos is used to interpolate the ROM. The method is applied to several stochastic systems of varying type of response (scalar/vector/matrix) and it shows considerable improvement in performance compared to existing simplex stochastic collocation methods and adaptive sparse grid collocation methods.},

The relevant limit state criterion is pointwise approximated by a tangent hyperplane. The combination of time-variant actions then reduces to the calculation of the maximum of a sum of random variables which is facilitated through proper, discrete approximation of extreme value and other non-normal distribution functions by normal distributions. The iteration algorithm searches for an approximation point on the limit state criterion where the probability content of the failure domain limited by the tangent hyperplane reaches its maximum. Any type of continuous limit state criterion and any distribution type for the loads can be dealt with. The method is illustrated for a section of a wall without tensile strength loaded by a bending moment and a normal force.}

abstract = {A general adaptive approach rooted in stratified sampling (SS) is proposed for sample-based uncertainty quantification (UQ). To motivate its use in this context the space-filling, orthogonality, and projective properties of SS are compared with simple random sampling and Latin hypercube sampling (LHS). SS is demonstrated to provide attractive properties for certain classes of problems. The proposed approach, Refined Stratified Sampling (RSS), capitalizes on these properties through an adaptive process that adds samples sequentially by dividing the existing subspaces of a stratified design. RSS is proven to reduce variance compared to traditional stratified sample extension methods while providing comparable or enhanced variance reduction when compared to sample size extension methods for LHS – which do not afford the same degree of flexibility to facilitate a truly adaptive UQ process. An initial investigation of optimal stratification is presented and motivates the potential for major advances in variance reduction through optimally designed RSS. Potential paths for extension of the method to high dimension are discussed. Two examples are provided. The first involves UQ for a low dimensional function where convergence is evaluated analytically. The second presents a study to asses the response variability of a floating structure to an underwater shock.}

abstract = {This paper compares space-filling and importance sampling (IS)-based Monte Carlo sample designs with those derived for optimality in the error of stratified statistical estimators. Space-filling designs are shown to be optimal for systems whose response depends linearly on the input random variables. They are, however, shown to be far from optimal when the system is nonlinear. To achieve optimality, it is shown that samples should be placed densely in regions of large variation (sparsely in regions of small variation). This notion is shown to be subtly, but importantly, different from other non-space-filling designs, particularly IS. To achieve near-optimal sample designs, the adaptive Gradient Enhanced Refined Stratified Sampling (GE-RSS) is proposed that sequentially refines the probability space in accordance with stratified sampling. The space is refined according to the estimated local variance of the system computed from gradients using a surrogate model. The method significantly reduces the error in stratified Monte Carlo estimators for strongly nonlinear systems, outperforms both space-filling methods and IS-based methods, and is simple to implement. Numerical examples on strongly nonlinear systems illustrate the improvement over space-filling and IS designs. The method is applied to study the probability of shear band formation in a bulk metallic glass.}

abstract = {An important challenge in structural reliability is to keep to a minimum the number of calls to the numerical models. Engineering problems involve more and more complex computer codes and the evaluation of the probability of failure may require very time-consuming computations. Metamodels are used to reduce these computation times. To assess reliability, the most popular approach remains the numerous variants of response surfaces. Polynomial Chaos [1] and Support Vector Machine [2] are also possibilities and have gained considerations among researchers in the last decades. However, recently, Kriging, originated from geostatistics, have emerged in reliability analysis. Widespread in optimisation, Kriging has just started to appear in uncertainty propagation [3] and reliability [4], [5] studies. It presents interesting characteristics such as exact interpolation and a local index of uncertainty on the prediction which can be used in active learning methods. The aim of this paper is to propose an iterative approach based on Monte Carlo Simulation and Kriging metamodel to assess the reliability of structures in a more efficient way. The method is called AK-MCS for Active learning reliability method combining Kriging and Monte Carlo Simulation. It is shown to be very efficient as the probability of failure obtained with AK-MCS is very accurate and this, for only a small number of calls to the performance function. Several examples from literature are performed to illustrate the methodology and to prove its efficiency particularly for problems dealing with high non-linearity, non-differentiability, non-convex and non-connex domains of failure and high dimensionality.}

abstract = {Bayesian inference has found widespread application and use in science and engineering to reconcile Earth system models with data, including prediction in space (interpolation), prediction in time (forecasting), assimilation of observations and deterministic/stochastic model output, and inference of the model parameters. Bayes theorem states that the posterior probability, p(H|Y˜) of a hypothesis, H is proportional to the product of the prior probability, p(H) of this hypothesis and the likelihood, L(H|Y˜) of the same hypothesis given the new observations, Y˜, or p(H|Y˜)∝p(H)L(H|Y˜). In science and engineering, H often constitutes some numerical model, ℱ(x) which summarizes, in algebraic and differential equations, state variables and fluxes, all knowledge of the system of interest, and the unknown parameter values, x are subject to inference using the data Y˜. Unfortunately, for complex system models the posterior distribution is often high dimensional and analytically intractable, and sampling methods are required to approximate the target. In this paper I review the basic theory of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and introduce a MATLAB toolbox of the DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm developed by Vrugt et al. (2008a, 2009a) and used for Bayesian inference in fields ranging from physics, chemistry and engineering, to ecology, hydrology, and geophysics. This MATLAB toolbox provides scientists and engineers with an arsenal of options and utilities to solve posterior sampling problems involving (among others) bimodality, high-dimensionality, summary statistics, bounded parameter spaces, dynamic simulation models, formal/informal likelihood functions (GLUE), diagnostic model evaluation, data assimilation, Bayesian model averaging, distributed computation, and informative/noninformative prior distributions. The DREAM toolbox supports parallel computing and includes tools for convergence analysis of the sampled chain trajectories and post-processing of the results. Seven different case studies illustrate the main capabilities and functionalities of the MATLAB toolbox.}

abstract = {In 1991 Morris proposed an effective screening sensitivity measure to identify the few important factors in models with many factors. The method is based on computing for each input a number of incremental ratios, namely elementary effects, which are then averaged to assess the overall importance of the input. Despite its value, the method is still rarely used and instead local analyses varying one factor at a time around a baseline point are usually employed. In this piece of work we propose a revised version of the elementary effects method, improved in terms of both the definition of the measure and the sampling strategy. In the present form the method shares many of the positive qualities of the variance-based techniques, having the advantage of a lower computational cost, as demonstrated by the analytical examples. The method is employed to assess the sensitivity of a chemical reaction model for dimethylsulphide (DMS), a gas involved in climate change. Results of the sensitivity analysis open up the ground for model reconsideration: some model components may need a more thorough modelling effort while some others may need to be simplified.}

The approach is also extended to the simulation of a general non-homogeneous oscillatory process characterized by an evolutionary power spectrum. Generalized forces involved in the modal analysis of linear or non-linear structures can be efficiently simulated as a multivariate process using the cross-spectral density matrix computed from the spectral density function of the multidimensional excitation process. Possible applications include simulation of (i) wind-induced ocean wave elevation, (ii) spatial random variation of material properties, (iii) the fluctuating part of atmospheric wind velocities and (iv) random surface roughness of highways and airport runways.}

abstract = {Abstract A random process can be represented as a series expansion involving a complete set of deterministic functions with corresponding random coefficients. Karhunen–Loeve (K–L) series expansion is based on the eigen-decomposition of the covariance function. Its applicability as a simulation tool for both stationary and non-stationary Gaussian random processes is examined numerically in this paper. The study is based on five common covariance models. The convergence and accuracy of the K–L expansion are investigated by comparing the second-order statistics of the simulated random process with that of the target process. It is shown that the factors affecting convergence are: (a) ratio of the length of the process over correlation parameter, (b) form of the covariance function, and (c) method of solving for the eigen-solutions of the covariance function (namely, analytical or numerical). Comparison with the established and commonly used spectral representation method is made. K–L expansion has an edge over the spectral method for highly correlated processes. For long stationary processes, the spectral method is generally more efficient as the K–L expansion method requires substantial computational effort to solve the integral equation. The main advantage of the K–L expansion method is that it can be easily generalized to simulate non-stationary processes with little additional effort. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {A unified and practical framework is developed for generating second-order stationary and non-stationary, Gaussian and non-Gaussian processes with a specified marginal distribution function and covariance function. It utilizes the Karhunen–Loeve expansion for simulation and an iterative mapping scheme to fit the target marginal distribution function. The proposed method has three main advantages: (a) processes with Gaussian-like marginal distribution can be generated almost directly without iteration, (b) distributions that deviate significantly from the Gaussian case can be handled efficiently and (c) non-stationary processes can be generated within the same unified framework. Four numerical examples are used to demonstrate the validity and convergence characteristics of the proposed algorithm. Based on these examples, it was shown that the proposed algorithm is more robust and general than the commonly used spectral representation method.}

abstract = {The computational efficiency of random field representations with the Karhunen–Loève (KL) expansion relies on the solution of a Fredholm integral eigenvalue problem. This contribution compares different methods that solve this problem. Focus is put on methods that apply to arbitrary shaped domains and arbitrary autocovariance functions. These include the Nyström method as well as collocation and Galerkin projection methods. Among the Galerkin methods, we investigate the finite element method (FEM) and propose the application of the finite cell method (FCM). This method is based on an extension to the FEM but avoids mesh generation on domains of complex geometric shape. The FCM was originally presented in Parvizian et al. (2007) [17] for the solution of elliptic boundary value problems. As an alternative to the L2-projection of the covariance function used in the Galerkin method, H1/2-projection and discrete projection are investigated. It is shown that the expansion optimal linear estimation (EOLE) method proposed in Li and Der Kiureghian (1993) [18] constitutes a special case of the Nyström method. It is found that the EOLE method is most efficient for the numerical solution of the KL expansion. The FEM and the FCM are more efficient than the EOLE method in evaluating a realization of the random field and, therefore, are suitable for problems in which the time spent in the evaluation of random field realizations has a major contribution to the overall runtime – e.g., in finite element reliability analysis.}

abstract = {Several methodologies utilize translation vector process theory for simulation of non-Gaussian stochastic vector processes and fields. However, translation theory imposes certain compatibility conditions on the non-Gaussian cross-spectral density matrix (CSDM) and the non-Gaussian marginal probability density functions (PDFs). For many practical applications such as simulation of wind velocity time histories, the non-Gaussian CSDM and PDFs are assigned arbitrarily. As a result, they are often incompatible. The generally accepted approach to addressing this incompatibility is to approximate the incompatible pair of CSDM/PDFs with a compatible pair that closely matches the incompatible pair. A limited number of techniques are available to do so and these methodologies are usually complicated and time consuming. In this paper, a novel iterative methodology is presented that simply and efficiently estimates a non-Gaussian CSDM that: (a) is compatible with the prescribed non-Gaussian PDFs and (b) closely approximates the prescribed incompatible non-Gaussian CSDM. The corresponding underlying Gaussian CSDM is also determined and used for simulation purposes. Numerical examples are provided demonstrating the capabilities of the methodology for both general non-Gaussian stochastic vector processes and a non-Gaussian vector wind velocity process.}

First, a range (x1,…,xm) is selected based on somewhat heuristic arguments. Second, the probabilities (p1,…,pm) of (x1,…,xm) are obtained from the solution of an optimization problem. Reduced order models are applied to calculate the distributions of the modal frequencies of a linear dynamic system with random stiffness matrix and statistics of the hydraulic head in a soil deposit with random heterogeneous conductivity. The performance of reduced order models in both applications is remarkable.}

Some important results concerning dependence modelling are given, such as the risk related to the use of a linear correlation matrix to describe the dependence structure, and the importance of tail dependence in probabilistic modelling for safety assessment. This contribution should allow the reader to be much more aware of the pitfalls in dependence modelling when relying solely on the Nataf transformation.}

We show how the bisection method can be applied to this formula to compute upper and lower bounds for δ2(A) differing by no more than a given amount. A key ingredient is a stable and efficient test for positive definiteness, based on an attempted Choleski decomposition. For accurate computation of δ2(A) we formulate the problem as one of zero finding and apply a hybrid Newton-bisection algorithm. Some numerical difficulties are discussed and illustrated by example.}
