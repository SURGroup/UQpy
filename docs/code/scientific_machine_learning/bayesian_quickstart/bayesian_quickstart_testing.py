Bayesian Quickstart Testing
===========================

# %% md
# This is the second half of a Bayesian version of the classification problem from this Pytorch Quickstart tutorial:
# https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html
#
# This script assumes you have already run the Bayesian Quickstart Testing script and saved the optimized model
# to a file named ``bayesian_model.pth``. This script
#
# - Loads a trained model from the file ``bayesian_model.pt``
# - Makes deterministic predictions
# - Makes probabilistic predictions
# - Plots probabilistic predictions
#
# First, we import the necessary modules and define the BayesianNeuralNetwork class, so we can load the model state
# dictionary saved in ``bayesian_model.pth``.

# are sampled from the distributions that were learned during training.
# Rather than one static output, we get a distribution of 1,000 predictions!

# We interpret this as our model being very likely to predict Ankle Boot.
