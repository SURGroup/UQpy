Bayesian Quickstart Training
============================
"""

# %% md
# This is the first half of a Bayesian version of the classification problem from this Pytorch Quickstart tutorial:
# (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html)
#
# We strongly recommend reading the Pytorch quick start first to familiarize yourself with the problem.
# We include many of the comments from the Pytorch example, but assume the reader is familiar with model definitions
# and parameter optimization in Pytorch.
# In their tutorial, Pytorch implements a fully connected deterministic neural network to learn a classification of
# articles of clothing. Here, we implement a fully connected *Bayesian* neural network to learn the same classification.
#
# We import all the same packages, with the addition of UQpy's scientific machine learning module.
# Note that this demo requires the ``torchvision`` package.

# %% md
# To construct a Bayesian classifier, we use UQpy's ``BayesianLinear`` layers in the ``nn.Module`` subclass.
# The ``BayesianLinear`` takes in the in features and out features just like ``nn.Linear``.
# The key difference is while the standard Linear layer has deterministic numbers for every element in its weight
# and bias tensors, a BayesianLinear layer has a representation of a random variable for each element in its tensors.

# Just like in Torch tutorials, we define our network using an instance of this custom class.
# The network is wrapped inside the ``sml.FeedForwardNeuralNetwork`` object, which does not change the network but gives
# us better control over the random variable behavior. By default, the model is set to sampling mode, where the weights
# and biases of each Bayesian layer are sampled from their governing distribution. We can turn sampling off,
# which causes the model to use the means of its distributions (and consequently behave deterministically) with the
# command ``model.sample(False)``. To turn sampling back on, use ``model.sample(True)``.

# %% md
# With our model defined, we can turn our attention to training. Training a Bayesian neural network uses Torch's
# ``optim`` library, and we can reuse almost all of their training and testing functions.
# We use the testing function from torch's quickstart tutorial, with a small modification to the loss function.
# We add a divergence term to the loss, which represents the likelihood of the posterior distribution in the Bayesian
# update. The default prior distribution in a Bayesian layer is a zero mean Gaussian, so this effectively acts as a
# regularization term driving the weights and biases towards zero. We scale down the divergence by a factor of
# :math:`10^{-6}` so it doesn't dominate the total loss.
#
# The test function is nearly identical to torch's, with the inclusion of a single line to ensure the
# sampling mode is set to ``False``.
