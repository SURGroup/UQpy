This module contains functionality for all the stochastic process methods supported in UQpy.

The module currently contains the following classes:

- ``SRM``: Class for simulation of Gaussian stochastic processes and random fields using the Spectral Representation
  Method.
- ``BSRM``: Class for simulation of third-order non-Gaussian stochastic processes and random fields using the
  Bispectral Representation Method.
- ``KLE``: Class for simulation of stochastic processes using the Karhunen-Loeve Expansion.
- ``Translation``: Class for transforming a Gaussian stochastic process to a non-Gaussian stochastic process with
  prescribed marginal probability distribution.
- ``InverseTranslation``: Call for identifying an underlying Gaussian stochastic process for a non-Gaussian process with
  prescribed marginal probability distribution and autocorrelation function / power spectrum.
