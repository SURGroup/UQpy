``DimensionReduction`` is the module for ``UQpy`` to perform the dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data.

This module contains the classes and methods to perform pointwise and multi point data-based dimensionality reduction
via projection onto Grassmann manifolds and Diffusion Maps, respectively. Further, interpolation in the tangent space
centered at a given point on the Grassmann manifold can be performed, as well as the computation of kernels defined on
the Grassmann manifold to be employed in techniques using subspaces.

The module currently contains the following classes:

* ``Grassmann``: Class for for analysis of samples on the Grassmann manifold.

* ``DiffusionMaps``: Class for multi point data-based dimensionality reduction.

* ``POD``: Class for dimension reduction of solution snapshots.
