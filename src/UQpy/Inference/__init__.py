This module contains classes and functions for statistical inference from data.

The module currently contains the
following classes:

* ``InferenceModel``: Define a probabilistic model for Inference.
* ``MLEstimation``: Compute maximum likelihood parameter estimate.
* ``InfoModelSelection``: Perform model selection using information theoretic criteria.
* ``BayesParameterEstimation``: Perform Bayesian parameter estimation (estimate posterior density) via MCMC or IS.
* ``BayesModelSelection``: Estimate model posterior probabilities.
