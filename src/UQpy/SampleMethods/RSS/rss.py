    """
    Parent class for Refined Stratified Sampling [10]_, [11]_.

    This is the parent class for all refined stratified sampling methods. This parent class only provides the
    framework for refined stratified sampling and cannot be used directly for the sampling. Sampling is done by
    calling the child class for the desired algorithm.

    **Inputs:**

    * **sample_object** (``SampleMethods`` object(s)):
        Generally, this must be an object of a ``UQpy.SampleMethods`` class. Each child class of ``RSS`` has it's
        own constraints on which specific types of ``SampleMethods`` it can accept. These are described in the child
        class documentation below.

    * **runmodel_object** (``RunModel`` object):
        A ``RunModel`` object, which is used to evaluate the model.

        `runmodel_object` is optional. If it is provided, the specific ``RSS`` subclass with use it to compute the
        gradient of the model in each stratum for gradient-enhanced refined stratified sampling. If it is not
        provided, the ``RSS`` subclass will default to random stratum refinement.

    * **krig_object** (`class` object):
        A object defining a Kriging surrogate model, this object must have ``fit`` and ``predict`` methods.

        May be an object of the ``UQpy`` ``Kriging`` class or an object of the ``scikit-learn``
        ``GaussianProcessRegressor``

        `krig_object` is only used to compute the gradient in gradient-enhanced refined stratified sampling. It must
        be provided if a `runmodel_object` is provided.

    * **local** (`Boolean`):
        In gradient enhanced refined stratified sampling, the gradient is updated after each new sample is added.
        This parameter is used to determine whether the gradient is updated for every stratum or only locally in the
        strata nearest the refined stratum.

        If `local = True`, gradients are only updated in localized regions around the refined stratum.

        Used only in gradient-enhanced refined stratified sampling.

    * **max_train_size** (`int`):
        In gradient enhanced refined stratified sampling, if `local=True` `max_train_size` specifies the number of
        nearest points at which to update the gradient.

        Used only in gradient-enhanced refined stratified sampling.

    * **step_size** (`float`)
        Defines the size of the step to use for gradient estimation using central difference method.

        Used only in gradient-enhanced refined stratified sampling.

    * **qoi_name** (`dict`):
        Name of the quantity of interest from the `runmodel_object`. If the quantity of interest is a dictionary,
        this is used to convert it to a list

        Used only in gradient-enhanced refined stratified sampling.

    * **n_add** (`int`):
        Number of samples to be added per iteration.

        Default: 1.

    * **nsamples** (`int`):
        Total number of samples to be drawn (including the initial samples).

        If `nsamples` is provided when instantiating the class, the ``run`` method will automatically be called. If
        `nsamples` is not provided, an ``RSS`` subclass can be executed by invoking the ``run`` method and passing
        `nsamples`.

    * **random_state** (None or `int` or ``numpy.random.RandomState`` object):
        Random seed used to initialize the pseudo-random number generator. Default is None.

        If an integer is provided, this sets the seed for an object of ``numpy.random.RandomState``. Otherwise, the
        object itself can be passed directly.

    * **verbose** (`Boolean`):
        A boolean declaring whether to write text to the terminal.

        Default value: False

    **Attributes:**

    Each of the above inputs are saved as attributes, in addition to the following created attributes.

        * **samples** (`ndarray`):
            The generated stratified samples following the prescribed distribution.

        * **samplesU01** (`ndarray`)
            The generated samples on the unit hypercube.

        * **weights** (`ndarray`)
            Individual sample weights.

        * **strata_object** (Object of ``Strata`` subclass)
            Defines the stratification of the unit hypercube. This is an object of the ``Strata`` subclass
            corresponding to the appropriate strata type.
