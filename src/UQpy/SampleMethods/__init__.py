This module contains functionality for all the sampling methods supported in ``UQpy``.

The module currently contains the following classes:

- ``MCS``: Class to perform Monte Carlo sampling.
- ``LHS``: Class to perform Latin hypercube sampling.
- ``MCMC``: Class to perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling.
- ``IS``: Class to perform Importance sampling.
- ``AKMCS``: Class to perform adaptive Kriging Monte Carlo sampling.
- ``STS``: Class to perform stratified sampling.
- ``RSS``: Class to perform refined stratified sampling.
- ``Strata``: Class to perform stratification of the unit hypercube.
- ``Simplex``: Class to uniformly sample from a simplex.
