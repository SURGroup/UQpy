class SROM:

    """
    Stochastic Reduced Order Model(SROM) provide a low-dimensional, discrete approximation of a given random
    quantity.

    **Inputs:**

    * **samples** (`ndarray`):
        An array/list of samples corresponding to the points at which the SROM is defined.

    * **target_dist_object** ((list of) ``Distribution`` object(s)):
        A list of distribution objects for each random variable.

    * **moments** (`list` of `float`):
        A list containing first and second order moment about origin of all random variables.

    * **weights_errors** (`list` of `float`):
        A list of weights associated with the error in distribution, moments and correlation.

        This corresponds to a list of the values :math:`a_{u}` in the objective function above.

        Default: weights_errors = [1, 0.2, 0]

    * **properties** (`list` of `booleans`):
        A list of booleans declaring the properties to be matched in the reduced order model.

        `properties[0] = True` matches the marginal distributions

        `properties[1] = True` matches the mean values

        `properties[2] = True` matches the mean square

        `properties[3] = True` matches the correlation

    * **weights_distribution** (`ndarray` or `list` of `float`):
        A list or array containing weights associated with matching the distribution at each sample value.

        `weights_distribution` is an array or list of shape `(m, d)` where each weight corresponds to the weight
        :math:`w_F(x_{k,i}; i)` assigned for matching the distribution of component `i` at sample point
        :math:`x_{k,i}`.

        If `weights_distribution` is `(1, d)`, it is assumed that each sample sample is equally weighted according
        to the corresponding weight for its distribution.

        Default: `weights_distribution` = An array of shape `(m, d)` with all elements equal to 1.

    * **weights_moments** (`ndarray` or `list` of `float`):
        An list or array containing weights associated with matching the moments about the origin for each
        component.

        `weights_moments` is a list or array of shape `(2, d), where each weight corresponds to the weight
        :math:`w_{\mu}(r; i)` assigned for matching the moment of order :math:`r = 1, 2` for component `i`.

        If `weights_moments` is `(1, d)`, it is assumed that moments of all order are equally weighted.

        Default: `weights_moments` = [[1/(moment[0][i]^2)], [1/(moment[1][i]^2)]] for i = 1, 2, ..., d.

    * **weights_correlation** (`ndarray` or `list` of `float`):
        A list or array containing weights associated with matching the correlation of the random variables.

        `weights_correlation` is a list or array of shape `(d, d)` where each weight corresponds to the weight
        :math:`w_R(i, j)` assigned for matching the correlation between component `i` and component `j`

        Default: `weights_correlation` = `(d, d)` array with all elements equal to 1.

    * **correlation** (`ndarray` or `list of floats`):
        Correlation matrix between random variables.

    **Attribute:**

    * **sample_weights** (`ndarray`):
        The probability weights defining discrete approximation of continuous random variables.

    **Methods:**
