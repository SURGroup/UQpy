This module contains functionality for all the surrogate methods supported in UQpy.

The module currently contains the following classes:

- ``SROM``: Class to estimate a discrete approximation for a continuous random variable using Stochastic Reduced Order
            Model.
- ``Kriging``: Class to generate an approximate surrogate model using Kriging.

- ``PCE``: Class to generate an approximate surrogate model using Polynomial chaos.
